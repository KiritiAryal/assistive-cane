# assistive-cane
## Release code for SoNIC 2022

### This is the project I did with SONIC lab at Cornell in a week long program. We made a smart assistive cane for visually impaired. It was successfully able to prevent bumping into obstacles in a controlled environment.
Below is the link for a short youtube video presentation of the whole program from Cornell.
